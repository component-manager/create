# web-platform
A Simple WebPlatform for web 4.0 Easy to build easy to extend no fear to drop legacy stuff

Replacing the IETF and W3C via Web Modules and Web 4.0 as also the new WInterCG which joins WinterCG and WICG.

As all WICG proposals can get directly implemented without asking a platform author.
